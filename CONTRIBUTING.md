# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this. You are probably much further into this, than I am.

_This is very much work in progress._

In the meantime, look at the [issue templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/).

Thanks, \

### Things I still want to have:

- Print-on-push as alternative to printing through `sources::diagnostic_set()`.
- Standalone printer
- Color-based printer (color for severity and hints below the source line, bold for filename and position)
- Bold/color inside `string::message` (important pieces of information)
- Warning-based message filters.
- _Low priority:_ way towards switching from {fmt} to C++20 / `std::format` as an alternative to `fmt::format`.
- Possibly, formatter for `string::argument`.
